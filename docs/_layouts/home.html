            <h3 class="title is-4">Installation</h3>
            <p>If you're familiar with NPM then BulmaJS is a breeze to install.</p>
            
            {% highlight bash %}
                {%- include code/installation/npm.sh -%}
            {% endhighlight %}

            <p>If you're not familiar with NPM or are not using in your project, you can instead download and copy the BulmaJS files into your project manually. I would highly recommend NPM is used as it makes it much easier to receive bug fixing updates, or new features when you need them.</p>

            <p>If your using Git then you can clone the repository to a location of your choice.</p>

            {% highlight bash %}
                {%- include code/installation/git.sh -%}
            {% endhighlight %}

            <h3 class="title is-4">Usage</h3>
            <p>BulmaJS is written using the ES6 Javascript version. This means that for the best browser compatibility the Javascript files need to be compiled to standard ES5 first. Each BulmaJS release comes with a range of files within a <code>dist</code> folder. These files are already compiled and can be loaded straight into a webpage.</p>
            
            <p>If you're only using one BulmaJS plugin, for example the Navbar, you can simply only load the <code>navbar.js</code> file inside the <code>dist</code> folder. This will load in the BulmaJS core (which is needed by all plugins) along with only the navbar plugin, keeping your file sizes as small as possible.</p>

            <p>If you're using a large amount of BulmaJS plugins, then it's advised to either include the entire <code>bulma.js</code> file that's inside the <code>dist</code> folder. Or use your own build process to create your own custom BulmaJS bundle. Using ES6 building your own bundle is as easy as just importing the plugins you would like to use.</p>

            {% highlight javascript %}
                {%- include code/usage/custom.js -%}
            {% endhighlight %}

            <p>This will now automatically include the BulmaJS core, and after your build process has run. You'll have your own custom BulmaJS bundle.</p>

            <p>While either option is available, I'll always recommend the ES6 approach. While it does require a little bit of setup if you do not already have a build process in place, it is much more flexible and ensures you're only pulling in code you're using.</p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Found an issue or need some help?</h3>
            <p>If you've found an issue with BulmaJS, or have a new feature you'd love to see please open an issue, detailing what the problem is, how to reproduce it and any other helpful information such as browser version and the version of the library you're using. Of cource, if possible a pull request to implement some kind of fix, would also be super useful!</p>

            <p>If you've thought of a new feature you'd like to see in the library, please do open an issue describing the feature and providing a use case or two. The library is split into 'plugins' that are all separate from each other. While the core file will be heavily restricted on what can/cannot be included, anyone can submit a useful plugin, they are all optional after all!</p>
